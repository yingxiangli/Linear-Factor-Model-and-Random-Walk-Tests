# Linear Factor Model and Random Walk Tests
 Linear Factor Model and Random Walk Tests

This repository includes the julia code to run the following tests:

TEST OF LINEAR FACTOR MODEL
1) time-series test of linear factor models (ap_test_time)
   - Users are able to use iid, time iid, Newey-West and Hansen-Hodrick covariance matrix
   - Users are able to use asymptotic and finite-distribution OLS and GMM tests
2) cross-sectional test of linear factor models (ap_test_cross)
   - Users are able to use iid, time iid, Newey-West and Hansen-Hodrick covariance matrix
   - Users are able to use OLS, GLS, OLS and GLS with Shanken correction, GMM and GLS GMM
3) cross-sectional test of linear factor models with the Fama-MacBeth procedure

TEST OF RANDOM WALK
1) Box and Pierce (1970) test
2) Ljung and Box (1978) test
3) variance ratio test
